# CS-340-Project-Two

# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

   Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs starts with clear organization, consistent structure, and meaningful documentation. In Project One, I designed the CRUD Python module with functions dedicated to creating, reading, updating and deleting records in the MongoDB database. By keeping these operations modular and using descriptive function names, I ensured that each piece of code had a single, clear purpose. I also added comments explaining how each function interacted with the database, which made the module easier to understand and update later.
   When I connected this CRUD module to the dashboard widgets in Project Two, the separation of logic made integration much smoother. The dashboard could call CRUD functions directly without duplicating code or altering the database logic. This modular design increased adaptability, allowing the same CRUD module to support different dashboards or future applications without major rewriting. 
   In the future, I could reuse or expand this module for other projects that need database connectivity, such as inventory systems, web apps, or analytics dashboards by simply updating the database name or adjusting the queries. 
 
# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

  As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them into smaller, logical components and designing solutions that can scale or adapt over time. For this project, Grazioso Salvare's requirements involved creating a dashboard that could display and manage animal rescue data. I began by analyzing the database structure, identifying key fields, and then designing how data would flow between the database and the user interface. 
    Compared to previous assignments, this project required me to think about real-world usability and data flow, not just individual functions. I had to ensure the system worked cohesively, connecting backend database operations with an interactive front end. I also learned to test the CRUD functions and dashboard interactions iteratively, confirming that updates to the database appeared immediately in the user interface. 
      In future projects, I would use a similar strategy: start with data modeling, define relationships and access patterns, and design the interface around those needs. I would also emphasize version control, documentation, and modular testing to ensure long-term reliability. 

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

  Computer scientists design, develop, and optimize systems that help people and organizations solve complex problems efficiently. Our work often involves transforming raw data into meaningful information that supports better decision-making. 
  In the case of Grazioso Salvare, my work helped create a tool that makes it easier for the company to analyze animal rescue data, identify patterns, and make informed choices about training or resource allocation. By providing a functional dashboard, I helped streamline their workflow, turning what could have been hours of manual data searching into just a few clicks.
  Projects like this show why computer science matters: we build solutions that improve accuracy, save time, and increase the impact of an organization's mission.
